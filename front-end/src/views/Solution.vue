          <p>Forget about filters and having to craft the perfect post. Your life is meant to be shared
            with the people who matter most. HomeBase makes it easy to strengthen relationships with family
            no matter how far you're spread apart.

          <p>HomeBase makes it easy for the whole family to stay in the loop -- even grandma!
            It's brining extended families into one place, so you can stay connected beyond
            the Christmas get-together and occasional reunion. It's the feed you actually should be scrolling!

      <div class="section-sub-container">
        <h3 class="section-sub-header">Like a Family Tree, but cooler and living</h3>
          <p>Never stumble into a family reunion blind ever again wondering who Uncle Bob's kids are. HomeBase
            is the perfect solution for extended families to see how everyone is linked together and
            make sure no one is forgotten.
